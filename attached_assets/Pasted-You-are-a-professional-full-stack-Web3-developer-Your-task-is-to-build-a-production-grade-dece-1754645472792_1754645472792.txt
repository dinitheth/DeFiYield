You are a professional full-stack Web3 developer.

Your task is to build a **production-grade decentralized application** named **IntentMesh** that enables users to create and fulfill private trade intents using Anoma-style logic and execute them via shielded token transfers on the **Namada mainnet**, supporting the **Namada Keychain Wallet**.

---

🚀 App Concept:

- Combine 70% Anoma-style local-first, intent-centric logic
- Use 30% Namada for shielded execution of matched trades
- Use Namada Keychain for user signing and wallet interaction
- No EVM, no gas UX – fully privacy-preserving, off-EVM

---

📌 What the App Must Do:

1. **Intent Creation**:
   - User defines a swap like “100 NAM → 50 ATOM”
   - Stored locally in browser (localStorage or IndexedDB)

2. **Intent Matching**:
   - App scans locally stored intents and finds compatible pairs
   - Solver logic runs client-side (Anoma-style)

3. **Fulfillment Trigger**:
   - Matched users click “Fulfill”
   - App opens Namada Keychain to sign & send shielded transfers

4. **On-chain Settlement**:
   - NAM, ATOM, OSMO, USDC tokens moved on Namada mainnet
   - All transfers are shielded via MASP

5. **Confirmation UI**:
   - Show real-time confirmation via Namada explorer or tx hash
   - Mark trade as complete and hide intents

📁 Pages Required:

1. **Home**
   - Hero section with intro
   - CTA: Create or Explore

2. **Create Intent**
   - Form with token, amount, receive, expiry
   - Show wallet address via Keychain
   - Store intent locally

3. **Explore**
   - Show existing intents
   - Match logic with button to fulfill
   - Fulfill = Open Namada Keychain to approve send

4. **Fulfilled Intents (optional)**
   - Show recently completed trades
   - Visualize swaps

✅ Final Notes:

- All dApp logic before “Fulfill” is 100% local-first (Anoma vision)
- All execution uses Namada’s real mainnet, not testnet or faucet
- No backend, no database – pure client-side architecture
- Support dark/light mode, mobile-responsive UI
- Theme must be clean, neutral – no bright colors, no cartoon logos
- Target user: privacy-focused DeFi users and protocol researchers

🎯 Output:

- GitHub-ready codebase
- Working demo (local or deployed)
- README.md with setup + references
- Components separated cleanly (Create, Match, Fulfill)
